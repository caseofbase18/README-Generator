# README Generator

This is my version of a README generator.  This is a command-line app allows the user to generate a thorough README.md to minimize time creating the README in order to spend more time working on the actual project.  This app dynamically creates the file using node.js and ES6+.  JavaScript and JSON are also used.  This application is invoked with the following command: node index.js.

## Video demonstrating functionality of app:
